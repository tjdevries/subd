## Begin's Comp died - Restart Speedrun

- I am running my server for Twitch eventsub locally!
  - so if it crashes...I have to unsub to all my events:

- restart on ngrok on 8080

- update the twitch dev console for beginworld to the new ngrok

-list all previous subs, and grab the IDs

- unsub to all those IDs

- run a script to to resub w/ the new ngrok callback URL
