## FUN IDEA New AI generated CSS every refresh

Everytime there is a new song played:
Ask AI for some new styling for the site
Create a new CSS file(Should we just update 1 CSS file? and archive the old one?)

Create By User Search?
!user_song "NAME_OF_USER"

Create search by Genre
How do we choose a video after seraching?
Just say videos that match a general search that hasn't been played in the last hour

Start Saving all combined videos
Easy way of showing video already created
This is the most important
