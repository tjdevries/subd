demons,\nStreet lights flicker, whole block boardin' lackin' reasons,\nInfrared beams, sights sharper than cleavers,\nCash moves everything around, circle of believers.\n[Verse 2]\nHoodied up, masked down, shadows blend in the chaos,\nCity of no pity, loud sounds, hittin' like seance,\nProduct of the dark, spittin' fire like a dragon,\nNo safety on the strap, click-clack, body's draggin'.\n[Chorus]\nGuttural shouts, whole block feel the quakin',\nCops sirens wail, neighborhood’s forsaken,\nRaw, uncensored, drill beats, hearts racin',\nHollow tips, metal claps, eternal confrontation.\n[Bridge]\nSmoke fills the lungs, vision blurry, movin' reckless,\nLife on edge, dance with death, so infectious,\nBroken dreams, shattered glass, clichés relentless,\nAdrenaline rush, survival mode, feelin' senseless.\n[Verse 3]\nCruisin' slow, eyes peeled, minds delirious,\nSoundtrack of the streets, hardcore and serious,\nFrom the curb to the crib, life lookin' mysterious,\nFast life, quick death, that's the drill experience.\n[Chorus]\nGuttural shouts, whole block feel the quakin',\nCops sirens wail, neighborhood’s forsaken,\nRaw, uncensored, drill beats, hearts
